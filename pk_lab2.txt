    *  --version
              output version information and exit

3. cal


SYNOPSIS
     cal [-31jy] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] [[month] year]
     cal [-31j] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] -m month [year]
     ncal [-C] [-31jy] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] [[month] year]
     ncal [-C] [-31j] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] -m month [year]
     ncal [-31bhjJpwySM] [-A number] [-B number] [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]
         [-s country_code] [[month] year]
     ncal [-31bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] [year]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi‐
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.


The options are as follows:

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display
             date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

  -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal
             number, appending ‘f’ or ‘p’ displays the same month of the fol‐
             lowing or previous year respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego‐
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the country_code.  If not specified, ncal tries
             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

 -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied
             when a year but no month are specified on the command line.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -1      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     -A number
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to
             the end of the display. This is in addition to any date range
             selected by the -y, -3, or -1 options. For example, “cal -y -B2
             -A2” shows everything from November of the previous year to Feb‐
             ruary of the following year. Negative numbers are allowed, in
             which case the specified number of months is subtracted. For
             example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to December. And “cal -A11”
             simply shows the next 12 months.

     -B number
             Months to add before. The specified number of months is added to
             the beginning of the display. See -A for examples.


  -C      Completely switch to cal mode. For cal like output only, use -b
             instead.

     -N      Switch to ncal mode.

     -d yyyy-mm
             Use yyyy-mm as the current date (for debugging of date selec‐
             tion).

     -H yyyy-mm-dd
             Use yyyy-mm-dd as the current date (for debugging of highlight‐
             ing).

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.


   A single parameter specifies the year (1–9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: “cal 89” will not display a calendar for
     1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a
     number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by
     the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current sys‐
     tem clock and time zone (so “cal -m 8” will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example, the options -y, -3,
     and -1 are mutually exclusive. If inconsistent options are given, the
     later ones take precedence over the earlier ones.

     A year starts on January 1.


4. bc


SYNTAX
       bc [ -hlwsqv ] [long-options] [  file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       bc  is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with inter‐
       active execution of statements.  There are  some  similarities  in  the
       syntax  to  the  C  programming  language.   A standard math library is
       available by command line option.  If requested, the  math  library  is
       defined before processing any files.  bc starts by processing code from
       all the files listed on the command line in the  order  listed.   After
       all  files  have been processed, bc reads from the standard input.  All
       code is executed as it is read.  (If a file contains a command to  halt
       the processor, bc will never read from the standard input.)

       This  version  of  bc contains several extensions beyond traditional bc
       implementations and the POSIX draft standard.  Command line options can
       cause these extensions to print a warning or to be rejected.  This doc‐
       ument describes the language accepted by  this  processor.   Extensions
       will be identified as such.

   OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print the usage and exit.

       -i, --interactive
              Force interactive mode.

       -l, --mathlib
              Define the standard math library.

       -w, --warn
              Give warnings for extensions to POSIX bc.

       -s, --standard
              Process exactly the POSIX bc language.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not print the normal GNU bc welcome.

       -v, --version
              Print the version number and copyright and quit.


       - expr The result is the negation of the expression.

       ++ var The variable is incremented by one and  the  new  value  is  the
              result of the expression.

       -- var The  variable  is  decremented  by  one and the new value is the
              result of the expression.

       var ++
               The result of the expression is the value of the  variable  and
              then the variable is incremented by one.

       var -- The  result  of  the expression is the value of the variable and
              then the variable is decremented by one.

       expr + expr
              The result of the expression is the sum of the two expressions.

       expr - expr
              The result of the  expression  is  the  difference  of  the  two
              expressions.

       expr * expr
              The  result  of the expression is the product of the two expres‐
              sions.

       expr / expr
                The result of the expression is the quotient of the two  expres‐
              sions.   The  scale  of  the result is the value of the variable
              scale.

       expr % expr
              The result of the expression is the "remainder" and it  is  com‐
              puted  in  the following way.  To compute a%b, first a/b is com‐
              puted to scale digits.  That result is used to compute a-(a/b)*b
              to  the scale of the maximum of scale+scale(b) and scale(a).  If
              scale is set to zero and  both  expressions  are  integers  this
              expression is the integer remainder function.


        expr ^ expr
              The result of the expression is the value of the first raised to
              the second.  The second expression must be an integer.  (If  the
              second  expression is not an integer, a warning is generated and
              the expression is truncated to get an integer value.)  The scale
              of  the  result  is  scale  if the exponent is negative.  If the
              exponent is positive the scale of the result is the  minimum  of
              the  scale  of the first expression times the value of the expo‐
              nent and the maximum of scale and the scale of the first expres‐
              sion.    (e.g.   scale(a^b)   =   min(scale(a)*b,   max(  scale,
              scale(a))).)  It should be noted that expr^0 will always  return
              the value of 1.

       ( expr )
              This  alters  the standard precedence to force the evaluation of
              the expression.

       var = expr
              The variable is assigned the value of the expression.

        var <op>= expr
              This is equivalent to "var = var <op> expr" with  the  exception
              that  the  "var"  part  is evaluated only once.  This can make a
              difference if "var" is an array.

       Relational expressions are a special kind  of  expression  that  always
       evaluate to 0 or 1, 0 if the relation is false and 1 if the relation is
       true.  These may appear in any legal expression.   (POSIX  bc  requires
       that  relational expressions are used only in if, while, and for state‐
       ments and that only one relational test may  be  done  in  them.)   The
       relational operators are

       expr1 < expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly less than expr2.

       expr1 <= expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is less than or equal to expr2.

       expr1 < expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly less than expr2.

       expr1 <= expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is less than or equal to expr2.

       expr1 > expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly greater than expr2.

       expr1 >= expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is greater than or equal to expr2.

       expr1 == expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is equal to expr2.

       expr1 != expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is not equal to expr2.

      Boolean  operations  are  also  legal.  (POSIX bc does NOT have boolean
       operations).  The result of all boolean operations are  0  and  1  (for
       false  and  true)  as in relational expressions.  The boolean operators
       are:

       !expr  The result is 1 if expr is 0.

       expr && expr
              The result is 1 if both expressions are non-zero.

       expr || expr
              The result is 1 if either expression is non-zero.

       The expression precedence is as follows: (lowest to highest)
                 || operator, left associative
              && operator, left associative
              ! operator, nonassociative
              Relational operators, left associative
              Assignment operator, right associative
              + and - operators, left associative
              *, / and % operators, left associative
              ^ operator, right associative
              unary - operator, nonassociative
              ++ and -- operators, nonassociative

       This precedence was chosen so that POSIX compliant bc programs will run
       correctly.  This will cause the use of the relational and logical oper‐
       ators to have some unusual behavior when used with  assignment  expres‐
       sions.  Consider the expression:
          a = 3 < 5

       Most C programmers would assume this would assign the result of "3 < 5"
       (the value 1) to the variable "a".  What this does in bc is assign  the
       value 3 to the variable "a" and then compare 3 to 5.  It is best to use
       parenthesis when  using  relational  and  logical  operators  with  the
       assignment operators.

       There  are  a  few  more  special  expressions that are provided in bc.
       These have to do with user defined functions  and  standard  functions.
       They  all  appear  as "name(parameters)".  See the section on functions
       for user defined functions.  The standard functions are:

       length ( expression )
              The value of the length function is the  number  of  significant

6 time



SYNOPSIS
       time   [ -apqvV ] [ -f FORMAT ] [ -o FILE ]
              [ --append ] [ --verbose ] [ --quiet ] [ --portability ]
              [ --format=FORMAT ] [ --output=FILE ] [ --version ]
              [ --help ] COMMAND [ ARGS ]

DESCRIPTION
       time run the program COMMAND with any given arguments ARG....  When
       COMMAND finishes, time displays information about resources used by
       COMMAND (on the standard error output, by default).  If COMMAND exits
       with non-zero status, time displays a warning message and the exit
       status.

       time determines which information to display about the resources used by
       the COMMAND from the string FORMAT.  If no format is specified on the
       command line, but the TIME environment variable is set, its value is used
       as the format.  Otherwise, a default format built into time is used.

       Options to time must appear on the command line before COMMAND.  Anything
       on the command line after COMMAND is passed as arguments to COMMAND.

OPTIONS
       -o FILE, --output=FILE
              Write the resource use statistics to FILE instead of to the
              standard error stream.  By default, this overwrites the file,
              destroying the file's previous contents.  This option is useful
              for collecting information on interactive programs and programs
              that produce output on the standard error stream.

       -a, --append
              Append the resource use information to the output file instead of
              overwriting it.  This option is only useful with the `-o' or
              `--output' option.

       -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
              Use FORMAT as the format string that controls the output of time.
              See the below more information.

  --help Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       -p, --portability
              Use the following format string, for conformance with POSIX
              standard 1003.2:
                        real %e
                        user %U
                        sys %S

       -v, --verbose
              Use the built-in verbose format, which displays each available
              piece of information on the program's resource use on its own
              line, with an English description of its meaning.

       --quiet
              Do not report the status of the program even if it is different
              from zero.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of time and exit.
